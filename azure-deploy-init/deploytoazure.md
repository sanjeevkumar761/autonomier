3\) *Wait for about 10 minutes* for installation monitoring layer inside jumpboxlinux VM to be ready \(It prepares automatically in background\)   
4\) Now, you can check installation progress on URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM\>:3000  \(you need to refresh the page manually to check progress until the Deployment progress reaches 100% which takes about 40-50 minutes)  
5\) You can check detailed installation logs on URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM\>:9001  


## Advanced - How to check detailed installation trace:     
1\) You can login to jumpbox VM as soon as it is shows Running state in Azure portal
